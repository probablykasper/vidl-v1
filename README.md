# Website
The website source code is located in the website folder.
## Get started
- Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- `npm install`: install the dependencies.
- `npm run build-prod`: build the website. The output is located inside the `docs` folder, so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages for free.
- `npm run build-dev`: Just like `build-prod`, but for development (it watches for changes).
- In `config.js`, you'll find the websocket URLs that the website connects to. One URL for local development and one for production.
In dev mode, the website is hosted on localhost:8080. You can change the port in `config.js`.

# Server
## Get started
- Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
- `docker-compose build`: Build the thing and install the NPM dependencies. This will build youtube-dl from source, so it will take a while.
- `npm run prod`: Starts the server in production mode. All it does is run `VIDL_ENV=prod docker-compose up`
- `npm run dev`: Starts the server in dev mode. All it does is run `VIDL_ENV=dev docker-compose up`

# Browser extension
Note: Only Chrome is officially supported at the moment.
The browser extension source code is located in the browser-extension folder.
## Get started
- Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- `npm install`: install the dependencies.
- `npm run build-prod`: build the website. It outputs a chrome folder that can be added as an unpackaged extension, and a chrome.zip file that can be added as a real extension.
- `npm run build-dev`: Just like `build-prod`, but for development (it watches for changes).
- In `config.js`, you'll find the websocket URLs that the website connects to. One URL for local development and one for production.
